# MyerSplash.Bot.NetCore
A telegram bot using ASP.NET Core.

## Usage

I think you have figured out how to use Telegram(which you should if you do need this Bot), just type @MyerSplashBot in the text box and send it to anyone else. Finally, click the highlight link to start a conversation to the bot.
